First, you will create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers. Second, you will use Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about your application.\n\n--- .class #id \n\n### Why are we here\n\nThe outcome of this project is to demonstrate basic skill in providing a web enabled (html5) applicaiton, and its supporting presentaion slidedeck.  \n\nI chose to reuse a project from the regression class, the linerar model regression of the Mtcars dataset.. \n\nThis dataset is included with R, and is provided by Motor Trend.\n\nIt is located at https://locarz.shinyapps.io/ddp-project/\n\n--- .class #id \n\n### Sample of running R within Slidify\n\nFor example, here is a pairwise plot of the dataset.  It's a nice way to quickly and visually explore the dataset..\n\n```{r}\npairs(mpg ~ ., data = mtcars)\n```\n\n--- .class #id \n\n### Review.  What have we demonstrated\n\n1. Shiny is a very flexiable tool for buiding interactive R applications\n2. Slidify is a great tool for quick presentations\n3. Rpub is a super easy way to deploy presentation from Sidify, when it works lol.\n\n\nThanks to all the instructors :)\n\n\n",
